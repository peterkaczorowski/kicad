/**
 * @file mdw_restart_policy.h
 * @brief The backoff schedule that governs backend respawns.
 *
 * A crashed backend is respawned with a growing delay, and after too many
 * restarts in a window the framework gives up and drops the session offline.
 * The policy is a pure function of the attempt timestamps so it can be tested
 * without spawning anything.
